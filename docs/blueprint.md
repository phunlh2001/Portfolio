# **App Name**: Phu's Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Theme Toggle: Allow users to switch between dark and light themes using a toggle button, preserving user preference via local storage.
- Navigation Bar: Implement a fixed top navigation bar with smooth scrolling to each section (Home, About Me, Skills, Contact).
- Home Section Animation: Incorporate a subtle fade-in text effect for the Home section's name and subtitle.
- Skills Carousel: Create automatically moving horizontal sliders/carousels for each skill group (Main, Extra, Tools) with a hover effect on each icon.
- Contact Form: Implement a minimal contact form with Name, Subject, and Content fields that sends form submissions to your email using a service like EmailJS. An AI tool could determine the type of query in the email's content and prioritize the contact for response
- CV Download: Link the "Download CV" button in the "About Me" section to the CV file to allow users to easily download your resume.
- Social Media Icons: Place GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email icons in the footer to increase contactability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) to create a feeling of competence, freshness, and welcome.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2E2E2E) provides a modern and sophisticated feel, which serves well in a portfolio that wants to signal both creativity and precision. This color will be inverted to #FAFAFA in light mode.
- Accent color: Light blue (#77B5FE), is used for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that delivers a modern, neutral feel and offers excellent readability.
- Use minimalist, custom-designed icons that align with the overall aesthetic.
- Implement a clean and well-structured layout with sufficient spacing to enhance readability and visual appeal. Ensure all sections are easily accessible via the navigation bar.
- Incorporate subtle and smooth transitions and animations throughout the website to enhance the user experience, such as fade-in effects, scroll animations, and hover effects on interactive elements.
